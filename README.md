# Qpick landing page

This is a landing page for an E-Wallet software I will be building 

## Things I have learned and used

- Built with crude frontend tech like HTML, Sass and vanilla JS only.
- Compressed images (loseless ) for performance optimization
- Animation implemented via `Intersection observer`. This ensure optimum perforamnce than to use event listener like `scroll` which constantly watches and cost performance on websites. Also, each observer is `unobserved` once the elements are observed (except the hero image and one circle) saving performance.
- Brushed up lot CSS tricks and learned a few more.

** NOTE ** 
I could further optimize the site but refrained from doing so since I would like to spend that time on the company/client websites than these freebie spins.
